- All of this information is found in [Getting Started • Naninovel](https://naninovel.com/guide/getting-started) 

#### Prerequisites

- Note: Naninovel is an extension for the Unity game engine, so you'll need to learn the actual basics of Unity before getting started with Naninovel.
- There is some scene related information that is relevant if you plan to build custom gameplay outside Naninovel. If you're not going to do this, you can ignore said information.

#### Create A New Unity Project 

- The recommended template when creating a project with Naninovel:
	- Unity template: Built-In Render Pipeline (BiRP) 

- While using 2D or 3D doesn’t matter, 2D is recommended so all images will  be turned to sprite assets by default. 

- If using 3D, you’ll have to manually change the import settings

-  Naninovel is scene independent, so you'll want to get rid of the `Main Camera` and `Directional Light` in the hierarchy window, since keeping them there could cause performance conflicts.

- You can even remove the sample scene itself, but make sure to keep at least one scene in the project for some editor features to work correctly.


#### Optimizing Editor Performance

- This step isn't needed, but can improve editor startup, reload and enter play mode times. Here is what to do:
    
- At the top of the toolbar, `Edit > Project Settings > Editor`
	- Under "Enter Play Mode Settings:"
		- When Entering Play Mode: `Do not reload Domain or Scene`
    

- When you're done with that, go to your File Explorer, we can make changes here too.
	- Locate the current project folder
	- In the folder, click the "Packages" folder
	- Open the `manifest.json` file (open it in Notebook if you prefer)
	- You're able to remove all except the below, as they aren’t needed by Naninovel:

{

    "dependencies": {

        "com.unity.modules.audio": "1.0.0",

        "com.unity.modules.video": "1.0.0",

        "com.unity.modules.imgui": "1.0.0",

        "com.unity.modules.uielements": "1.0.0",

        "com.unity.modules.particlesystem": "1.0.0",

        "com.unity.modules.imageconversion": "1.0.0",

        "com.unity.ugui": "2.0.0"

    }

}

#### VCS Setup
- If you're using a version control system (VCS) like Git, you can make a .gitignore for the following paths to prevent unneeded churn:

```
# Auto-generated Unity assets of transient nature. /Assets/NaninovelData/Transient* 
# Transient artifacts of the external tools. 
/Assets/NaninovelData/.nani/Transient*
```

- Note: The `Assets/NaninovelData` folder is autogenerated. Feel free to rename or move it to any folder under `Assets`, though the .gitignore paths need to be update accordingly.
- There is a sample of the .gitignore on  [this page](https://naninovel.com/guide/samples) 

#### Install Naninovel

- Naninovel is distributed across 3 release streams:
	- Preview
		- Updated most- has all the latest features
		- Has bugs and breaking changes
		- Recommended when you’re in development or need a specific feature not available in other releases
    - Stable
		- Doesn’t have the latest features
	    - Only receives bug fixes
	    - Free from any breaking changes
    	- Recommended in most cases
	- Final 
		- Most tested and stable
		- Most outdated- not covered by tech support
		- Stay on this only when the project is already released and not possible to upgrade


#### Install from GitHub

- [Register your Naninovel license](https://account.naninovel.com/identity/account/register) and follow the instructions on the dashboard to access the repository.
-  After the repository’s been accessed, go to Unity. 
-  At the top of the toolbar, `Window > Package Manager > Go to the plus button (+) > Add package from git URL`
- Add “[https://github.com/naninovel/upm.git#X.X](https://github.com/naninovel/upm.git#X.X)” (X.X is the Naninovel release version you want to install)
	- Note: If you're not authenticated  as the GitHub user on your local machine, you'll get an error when installing the package.

#### Install from Asset Store

- If you bought Naninovel from the Asset Store, you can install and update it from the “My Assets” tab of the package manager. [Found here.](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-import.html)
#### Install From Package
- You can install Naninovel from a `.unitypackage` file. Unless you've downloaded Naninovel from the Asset Store, you can get the package from Naninovel's [download archive ↗](https://account.naninovel.com/download) 
- It's recommended to install Naninovel directly from GitHub for the latest updates.

#### Core Concepts Skim
- These are Naninovel's core concepts, something you should look at before using Naninovel.

- Actor
    - An entity described by:
	    - Identifier (ID)
		- Appearance
		- Position in space (scene)    
	- Not abstract and can’t exist directly, so specialized versions with more parameters are used, like:	
		- Character
		- Background
		- Text printers
		- Choice handler
	- So essentially, these are empty game objects you can use to set up everything.
	- Actors and their parameters are controlled via commands in [Naninovel scripts.](https://naninovel.com/guide/naninovel-scripts)
- User Interface (UI) [[16. User Interface]]
	- Used by the player to interact with actors and the rest of the game
	- Menus, control panels, and the like
	- Positioned on top of the actors by default (makes sense since we don’t want characters or backgrounds disrupting the flow)
	- Note that text printers and choice handlers are considered both actors and UI
		- By this, they can be controlled through the Naninovel script like an actor, and have players interact with them, like UI.

#### Add Naninovel Script

- In your "Project" window, make a “Scenario” folder.
	- (`Right click > Create > Folder`)
	- This holds all your Naninovel scenario script assets
- Make a scenario script
	- In the "Scenario" folder, `Create > Naninovel > Naninovel Script`
- Notes:
	- You can set it up how you’d like, but know that all scenario scripts *have* to be stored in *one*  root directory
	- Unity treats folders called “Resources” special- assets stored there are force-included to the build, which could cause performance issues.
	- *Never* store anything in the Resources/Naninovel folder unless specifically required.
- Please note that Naninovel scripts are text documents. (`.nani`) 
	- Can be edited through Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or VS Code 
	- You can also use the visual script editor to edit the scripts.
		- If you click the asset, you’ll see the editor open up in the Inspector.
- Add a new line to the script
	- Two methods
		- Right click the place in the script where you want it
		- `Ctrl+Space` (or whichever key binding you've changed this command to) and choose the line or command type you want.
- Reorder lines
	- Drag the lines by their number labels
		- Remember to save after these changes, as the visual editor will have an asterisk (`*`) over the script.
- Make the Naninovel asset visible for the engine
	- It needs to be assigned as a project source.
		- Don't worry, when making scripts via the “create assets” menu, they’re auto assigned.
	- Assign, edit, or remove a script resource:
		- `Naninovel > Resources > Scripts` (There should be a Naninovel at Unity’s toolbar.) 
		- Add a script:
	    	- Press the plus button (+) on the list to add a new record
			- Drag and drop the script asset to the list
			- Can be drag dropped in batches (multiple assets or even a folder containing assets)
			![[Pasted image 20250716130403.png]]
- Just in case the “New Game” button of the title menu isn’t active:
	- `Naninovel > Configuration > Scripts`, 
	- The "Start Game Script "must be equal to the name of the created script.

#### Add Character

- Characters:
	- Can be based on regular or diced sprites
	- Animated Live 2D
	- Spine models
	- Meshes
	- Anything you’d like as well
- Each character is represented by ID and a set of “Appearances”
    
- Add a character (This is after you make one)
	- Naninovel > Resources > Characters
	- Name it (this will be its ID)
	- Double click it (or press the button beside it) to access its resources
	- Add all appearance sprites to the “Appearances” list (multi drag and drop works here too)
		- Path: Default, Object: Default (Sprite)
		- Path: Angry, Object: Angry (Sprite)
		- Things like that.
- Using these characters
	- Let’s say you have a character with the ID “Lucy”
	- How to show this character in the Naninovel script:
		`@char Lucy
		`Hello World!
		`@stop`
	- Note: if you don’t specify an appearance (`Lucy.Angry`, `Lucy.Sad`), either the appearance named that equals the character’s ID or “Default” will show by default.
- Specify a certain appearance
	- `Character.path` is the syntax
```
	`Lucy.Angry
	`@char Lucy.Angry
	`Hello World!
	`@stop
```
	Understand? Try some yourself.
- Make sure there’s an actual path for appearances
	- How to save yourself some typing: join a character's appearance with printed text:
		```
		Lucy.Angry: Hello World!
		@stop
		```
- Hide a character
```
		Lucy.Angry: Hello World!
		@hide Lucy
		@stop
```
- This works with *any* actor (like background, text, printer, etc.).
#### Add Background
- Backgrounds
	- Can be represented in different ways
		- Naninovel sprite
		- Generic object
		- Video
		- Scene
		- Custom user implementation
- You *can* make different backgrounds, but you’d only need to transition one background and change its appearance, so it makes sense to make only one.
- Luckily, there already *is* a MainBackground actor by default. All we have to do is add appearances to it.
- Add a background sprite
	- At the Unity toolbar: `Naninovel > Resources > Backgrounds
	- MainBackground  is there default
- Using backgrounds
	- Say you have the background “City,” you would use `@back` to show that certain background
		`@back City
- Say you want to switch and add an effect to it:
	`@back City
	`@back School.Radial Blur
- To reference a background other than the main one, specify the ID of that background actor
	- Imagine a background actor that has the “Flower” ID. Imagine there are 2 of them.
		`@back Bloomed id:Flower
		`@back Withered id:Flower
		- If there is a background actor with the ID `Flower`, this will change its appearance from `Bloomed` to `Withered`

### Add Music and Sound Effects

- Adding SFXs or BGMs
	- [Note that only these audio formats are supported by Unity.](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioFiles.html) 
	- Add BGM
		- Unity Toolbar, `Naninovel > Resources > Backgrounds
		- Add your audio in the list, just like you did the chara actors
			- Say you have the BGM `BigCity`, use `@bgm` then the name of the track
				`@bgm BigCity
		- Note: these loop by default.
		- A cross fade effect is auto-applied when switching tracks
			- Cross fade: the first BGM will die down in volume, leading to the second track to begin 
		- Volume and fade duration can also be changed using command parameters
		- Sound effects will NOT loop on default
	- Add SFX
		-  use `@sfx`, then the name of the track
			`@sfx Explosion
- Tip: Assets (settings, resources, various caches) will be automatically generated the more you use Naninovel. You can move or rename them, just *don't* store it under the "Resources" folder- it'll cause conflicts.
