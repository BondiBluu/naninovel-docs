## Configuration

- The engine configuration is stored in multiple scriptable object assets located at the  `Assets/NaninovelData/Resources/Naninovel/Configuration` folder.
- To access the configuration menu :
	- From the Unity toolbar:
		- `Naninovel > Configuration`
			or
		- `Edit > Project Settings > Naninovel`
- Note: all configuration menus support [Unity's preset feature](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Presets.html) 
	- You can make a large number of different presets for the same game on different devices (mobile, console, etc).
- There’s a *large* list of properties on this page. Be sure to look at it using the link at the top of this section.
- Don’t worry about memorizing it now, it should be muscle memory later.
